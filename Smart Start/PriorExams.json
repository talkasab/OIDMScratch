        LUNGS: There is mild biapical scarring, similar to the previous
        exam. There is mild subsegmental atelectasis within the dependent
        portion of the lung bases as well as atelectasis adjacent to
        thoracic osteophytes medially within the right lower lobe.

        grossly unremarkable. The adrenal glands are normal in size and
        configuration. There is diverticular disease of the colon.
